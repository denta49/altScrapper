# altScrapper

Hello!

It's a tool that allows you to take all alt attributes in your directory and save them to JSON. 

AltScrapper saves also alt, and it's location to help you to navigate 
and eventually change it. 

It iterates through files and folders in directory with recurrency function, not URL. 

Bugs to fix: sometimes there is a problem with encoding. It should check files with exact extension, no all of them.
